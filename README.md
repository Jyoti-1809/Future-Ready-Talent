Diabetes Predictor in Jupyter Notebook

This is a project which helps to predict that a person has diabetes or not.

Steps:
1) Import libraries
2) Reading the dataset
3) Data preprocessing
4) Train test Data
5) Data visualization
6) Present the solution

The project helps doctors to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI and many more. If it is untreated then may cause some major issues in a person like: heart related problems, kidney problem, blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affects other organs of human body. Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. -Machine learning techniques provide better result for prediction by constructing models from datasets collected from patients. So the main purpose of this project is to predict diabetes in persons and if the result is positive, doctors can treat the patients to overcome the disease.
